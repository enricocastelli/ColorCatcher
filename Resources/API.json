"name": "Coca Cola's red",
"desc": "You may think that the red color come from one of the company’s first advertisements, which featured Santa Claus wearing his famous red-and-white suit and holding a Coke bottle. But according to the Coca-Cola Company, its famous logo dates back to the very beginning of the brand itself.  Over 130 years ago, Coca-Cola was sold in barrels at American drug stores and pharmacies. Alcohol was distributed in the same way. But while alcohol was taxed at the time, soft drinks were not. So, the Coca-Cola Company began painting its barrels red in order to help customs and tax officials distinguish them from barrels of booze."

"name": "Simpson's skin",
"desc": "The Simpsons are one of the most successful TV series all time, impersonating American cultures for decades. Why yellow though? Matt Groening explained it in a BBC interview: `An animator came up with the Simpsons' yellow and as soon as she showed it to me I said: 'This is the answer!' because when you're flicking through channels with your remote control, and a flash of yellow goes by, you'll know you're watching The Simpsons.` Since then, this is their characteristic, unique color."

"hex": "e3a857",
"name": "Indian yellow",
"desc": "Created in a remote Indian village where they fed cows nothing but mango leaves, which left them malnourished but made their pee bright shining yellow. People would collect the pee, dry it, press it into cakes, and eventually some of it would arrive in Europe. That’s the story, anyway. As far as I can tell, no one actually knows for sure how it was made, nor have they really tried. If you buy 'Indian Yellow' today, you’re getting an artificial mixture of things that aren’t mango-cow-urine. What a rip off."
