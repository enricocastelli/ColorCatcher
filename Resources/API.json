These white bugs produced a potent red dye so sought-after by artists and patrons that it quickly became the third greatest import out of the “New World” (after gold and silver), as explains Victoria Finlay in A Brilliant History of Color in Art. Raphael, Rembrandt, Rubens, all used cochineal as a glaze, layering the pigment atop other reds (like red ochre) to increase their intensity.
