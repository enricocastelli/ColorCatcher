# Timer mode: 
  App generates a random color and the user has 1 minute to recognise as many colors he can.
  Everytime a color is catched, a new random color pops up.

# Discovery mode:
  User has to recognise a series of famous colors. No time here. And the matching has a higher tolerance. 
  After he recognise it, it comes a brief explanation of the color. The player's progress is saved. 
  Possible path here:
    - colors used in famous brands.
    - set of colors used in famous paintings.
    
# VS Mode:
  User can connect with another phone and battle on who can find more colors. 

# Collection 
User can go trough all the colors he catched on DiscoveryMode and clicking on it can check it's description and the time/place of the catch.
